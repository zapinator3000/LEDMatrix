# LEDMatrix
A 4x4 Raspberry Pi LED matrix display
This is just a fun little project I've been working on, and I want to release this to everyone.
It only took me a few hours to wire the circuit and put together a somewhat bad python script.

The matrix relies on the basic principles of the polarities of diodes.
Since Diodes only let current flow in one direction, when the polarity is reversed it turns the specific pixel turned off.
See the attached circuit diagram on how to wire it.
