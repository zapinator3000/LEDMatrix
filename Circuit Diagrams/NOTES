Notes about LED choices:

In my diagram, I assume you are using a 30mA 3.2 volt LED.
Depending on your LED, it may be necessary to place a resistor between the anode of the LED and the Raspberry Pi.
For example, for a 1.5 volt LED, I would recommend using a 60 to 100 ohm resistor in parallel with the LED. 
Really, the bigger the better for the resistor (As long as it does not drop the voltage below the minimum voltage of the LED)
